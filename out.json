[{"filename": "texts/oscar_wilde.txt", "response": {"summary": " \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" is a play by Oscar Wilde, first performed on February 14, 1895. It is a farcical comedy about two young men who lead double lives, both using the name Ernest to court two women. The play satirizes Victorian manners and features characters like Lady Bracknell and Miss Prism. Although it received praise for its humor, some critics noted its lack of social messages. The play marked the peak of Wilde's career but was followed by his downfall due to legal troubles stemming from his relationship with Lord Alfred Douglas. Despite its initial success, the play closed after 86 performances due to Wilde's disgrace. After his release from prison, Wilde published the play in Paris but did not write any more comic works.\n\n", "qna": [{"Q": " Is \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" a play by Oscar Wilde?  \n", "A": true}, {"Q": " Did the play first perform on February 14, 1895?  \n", "A": true}, {"Q": " Is the play a serious drama with deep social messages?  \n", "A": false}, {"Q": " Did Oscar Wilde face legal troubles after the play's success?  \n", "A": true}, {"Q": " Did Wilde write more comic works after publishing the play in Paris?  \n", "A": false}]}}]
