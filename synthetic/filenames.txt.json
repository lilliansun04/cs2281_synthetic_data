      "summary": "\"The Importance of Being Earnest is a play by Oscar Wilde that showcases a farcical comedy centered around two young men leading double lives to escape social obligations. The play features memorable characters, including the formidable Lady Bracknell, and is celebrated for its sharp wit and humor. Despite its initial success, Wilde's career took a tragic turn due to his imprisonment for homosexual acts shortly after the play's debut. The play's closure after 86 performances marked a significant moment in Wilde's life, as he faced societal backlash. Ultimately, Wilde published the play from exile in Paris, but he never returned to writing comic or dramatic works.\""
