Original Summary: The trial of Olympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius, charged with the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, is set to begin in March 2014.

Original Summary: Irish voters are participating in a referendum to decide on the Lisbon Treaty, which they previously rejected over a year ago. The treaty aims to modernize the EU's governance structure, and this time, the "yes" campaign is gaining traction, bolstered by assurances from the EU regarding Ireland's abortion laws and neutrality. However, the backdrop of Ireland's economic recession and domestic discontent may influence voter sentiment, raising concerns that the outcome could reflect anger over local issues rather than the treaty itself.

Original Summary: Congress has revived the privatization of airport screening, allowing more airports to opt out of TSA oversight. TSA administrator John Pistole must approve these requests unless they pose a security risk, despite his previous stance that airport screening should remain a federal responsibility. The debate continues, with Democrats warning against the dangers of privatization reminiscent of pre-9/11 security, while Republicans argue that the current TSA system is inefficient and costly.

TSA administrator John Pistole must approve these requests unless they pose a security risk, despite his previous stance that airport screening should remain a federal responsibility. The debate continues, with Democrats warning against the dangers of privatization reminiscent of pre-9/11 security, while Republicans argue that the current TSA system is inefficient and costly.

Original Summary: The trial of Olympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius, charged with the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, is set to begin in March 2014. Pistorius faces premeditated murder charges following the shooting death of Steenkamp on Valentine's Day, which he claims was a case of mistaken identity. The police investigation has concluded that there is sufficient evidence for the case to proceed, and the trial may extend over a year due to potential delays.

Original Summary: Irish voters are participating in a referendum to decide on the Lisbon Treaty, which they previously rejected over a year ago. The treaty aims to modernize the EU's governance structure, and this time, the "yes" campaign is gaining traction, bolstered by assurances from the EU regarding Ireland's abortion laws and neutrality. However, the backdrop of Ireland's economic recession and domestic discontent may influence voter sentiment, raising concerns that the outcome could reflect anger over local issues rather than the treaty itself.

Original Summary: Congress has revived the privatization of airport screening, allowing more airports to opt out of TSA oversight. TSA administrator John Pistole must approve these requests unless they pose a security risk, despite his previous stance that airport screening should remain a federal responsibility. The debate continues, with Democrats warning against the dangers of privatization reminiscent of pre-9/11 security, while Republicans argue that the current TSA system is inefficient and costly.
